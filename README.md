# The lab of 15-213: Intro to Computer Systems: Fall 2015 version

### This Repo is for the lab of [CMU-15-213: Intro to Computer Systems](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/labs.html) 
### or 
### The lab from book :  *Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3/E (CS:APP3e)*

### Running Environment: Ubuntu 18.04

### **Updating...**

- [x] **1. DataLab** : Students implement simple logical, **two's complement, and floating point functions**, but using a highly restricted subset of C.This lab helps students understand the bit-level representations of C data types and the **bit-level behavior** of the operations on data.
- [x] **2. BombLab** : The lab teaches students to understand **assembly language**, and also forces them to learn how to use a debugger. It's also great fun. A legendary lab among the CMU undergrads.
- [x] **3. AttackLab** : Students are asked to modify the behavior of the targets by developing exploits based on either **code injection or return-oriented programming**. This lab teaches the students about the stack discipline and teaches them about the danger of writing code that is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks.
- [x] **4. CacheLab:** Students write a general-purpose cache simulator, and then optimize a small matrix transpose kernel to minimize the number of misses on a simulated cache. This lab uses the Valgrind tool to generate address traces. **Note: This lab must be run on a 64-bit x86-64 Linux system.**
- [ ] **5. ShellLab:** Students implement their own simple Unix shell program with job control, including the ctrl-c and ctrl-z keystrokes, fg, bg, and jobs commands. This is the students' first introduction to application level concurrency, and gives them a clear idea of Unix process control, signals, and signal handling.
